While	 the Data	 Interchange Output Layer	 is	 where	 the HTML	 and JSON are	utilized	 to	publish	 the	contents	generated	by	 the	NAS,	and	 these contents	will	 then	 be output	and	transferred	 to	 the	User	 Execution	 Layer for	users	 to execute business and	buying decisions. The	users	could	make instructions	 or	 requests,	 such	 as	 agreeing	 the	 partnership, to	 the winemaker’s	back-end	database	using	the	“Partners”	version	of web-based database	with	the	desktop,	laptop	or	smartphone through	using	HTML.	The instructions,	such	as	wine	acceptance,	updating	the	transaction	record	and requesting	 for	 specific	 wine	 record	 while	 at	 the	 retail points, can	 also	 be made by	scanning	an	NFC	tag attached	on	the	wine	bottle and	transmitted back	to	the	Wine	Database	Layer through	the	JSON.	The	JSON	could	ensure the machine-to-machine	 without	 human	 intervention	 to	 suit	 the	 fastmoving	nature	 of	 the	 supply	chain through	using	 the	NFC	 tag as	 the	apps will	send	data	output	with	this	 format	to	the	Application	Controller	Layer, which	is	also	the	reason	of	employing	NFC in	the	track-and-trace	system	in	which	the associated decisions	will be	made	automatically	by	the	machines (the	apps	and	the	controllers). The	red	line stands	 for	 the	 fact	 that	 the	NFC-enabled	 smartphone	 could	 send	 requests	 to	 the	Wine	Database Layer	through	both	the	HTML	and	JSON as	the	smartphone	itself	can	access	mobile	version	of	the web-based	 databases	 of	 those	 supply	 chain	 partners	 and	 perform	 those	 NFC-related	 functions with	the	app	running	on	it	respectively
