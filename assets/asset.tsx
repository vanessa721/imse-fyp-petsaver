      Privacy Policy
      
      Pet Rescuer is committed to protecting the personal data you provide to us. Our policies and procedures are designed to ensure that your personal data is protected. We undertake to comply with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) (the "Privacy Ordinance") when collecting, holding, processing or using personal data in Hong Kong.
      
      In this Privacy Policy, references to "you" (or "your") refer to Pet Rescuer users who provide Pet Rescuer with personal data. "Personal Data" means personally identifiable information, as defined in the Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy contains the following important information about your interactions with us: 
      
      Principles: 1. Collection of personal data; 2. Use of Personal Data; 3. Data Quality; 4. Data Security.
      
      Principle 1 - Collection of Personal Data
      Pet Rescuer will only collect personal data that is necessary and will only be used for personal data directly related to the services we provide and the purpose of personal data collection set out in the Personal Data Collection Statement ("Primary Purpose").
      Pet Rescuer will only collect personal data in a lawful and fair manner. We collect your personal data when you use or browse the app and submit other data (including personal data). We may also collect your personal data when you submit a proposal form.
      When you use Pet Rescuer's app, we will automatically collect certain information because your IP address needs to be confirmed by the server. We may use IP address information to monitor and analyse the usage of some Pet Rescuer.
      At or before Pet Rescuer collects personal data from you, Pet Rescuer will take practical steps to ensure that you are aware of:
      a) the purpose of collecting and using personal data;
      b) categories of persons to whom Pet Rescuer may transfer personal data;
      c) you provide the personal data compulsorily or voluntarily;
      d) If you are compelled to provide personal data, set out the consequences of your choice not to provide personal data;
      e) your right to request access to and request correction of personal data; and
      f) the name and address of the person at the time of the request.
      
      Principle 2 - Use of Personal Data
      Pet Rescuer will only use your personal data for the following purposes other than the primary purpose ("secondary purpose"):
      a) the secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose of collection; or
      b) you consent to the use or disclosure; or
      c) any exemptions applicable under the Privacy Ordinance.
      Pet Rescuer may share collected personal data with the persons listed in the Personal Data Collection Statement.
      
      Principle 3 - Data Quality
      Pet Rescuer will take practical steps to ensure that the personal data it collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and current after considering the purposes for which it uses or will use personal data (including any directly related purposes). Pet Rescuer will retain your personal data for the period required by law and regulation for the purposes set out in Principles 1 and 2 above and the Personal Data Collection Statement. Pet Rescuer will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal data when it is no longer necessary for this purpose.
      
      Principle 4 - Data Security
      Pet Rescuer will take all practicable steps to ensure that the personal data we hold is protected against unauthorized or accidental access, processing, erasure or other use. Pet Rescuer provides a highly secure network infrastructure to conduct activities in this app, including HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encryption and the use of firewalls and anti-virus software. Pet Rescuer's network infrastructure is closely monitored and maintained.
